# unit-4-game

## Overview

This is one of the hime work I decide to redo it to make it better front end design as well as more clean javascript coding. This game is to design given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystal balls. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to random number, you loss the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the value of each crystal.

## Challenge

The challenge I had is to use JQuery to apply CSS. I've learned through the process and applied to many of my own apps with similar approach
